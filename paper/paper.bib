	abstract = {Scientific research relies on computer software, yet software is not always developed following practices that ensure its quality and sustainability. This manuscript does not aim to propose new software development best practices, but rather to provide simple recommendations that encourage the adoption of existing best practices. Software development best practices promote better quality software, and better quality software improves the reproducibility and reusability of research. These recommendations are designed around Open Source values, and provide practical suggestions that contribute to making research software and its source code more discoverable, reusable and transparent. This manuscript is aimed at developers, but also at organisations, projects, journals and funders that can increase the quality and sustainability of research software by encouraging the adoption of these recommendations.},

	abstract = {It is easy to concentrate on short-term issues when developing research software. Getting publications, collaboration with others and the demands of a daily research routine can all conspire to prevent proper planning for the development of research software. A Software Management Plan can help us to define a set of structures and goals to help us to understand what we are going to write, who it is for, how we will get it to them, how will it help them, and how we will assess whether it has helped them. They also help us to understand what processes, resources and infrastructure we need and how we can use these to meet our own goals, in the short, medium and long term. They also encourage us to think about the future of our software once our project or funding period ends, and what our plans for its long-term sustainability are. This checklist is intended to help researchers write software management plans.},
